# Asset Analysis and Financial Models for Geodesignhub

Using this library you can build and develop financial scenarios for your designs. You can set costs of construction, expected income, operating expenses and maintenance to calculate the Net Present Value. You can also set additional asset details such as expected visitors, expected workers etc. All of this information can then be aggregated across your study area and summarized to generate a unique spatial, financial analysis.

## Introduction

This plugin enables comprehensive financial and asset analysis for your Geodesignhub projects. It uses the [Geodesignhub API](http://www.geodesignhub.com/api/) to download data from your project and provide a series of controls to analyze and set potential uses of this asset, conduct financial Analysis and finally conduct a investment summary. Using the data import / export feature you can take the model data out and generate and load different financial scenarios.

## Bulk update Financial Details

A design has number of diagrams and you can set / update basic financial data for a design in a Excel like user interface.

## Financial Analysis

This module helps you refine and understand the Financial Information associated with the diagram. It is focused on the capital investment expected return of investment by doing a "Net Present Value" analysis on the diagram.

You can enter the following parameters:

- __Capital Expenditure / Initial investment__ needed to build the asset.
- __Start year__ for the investment and the __end year__ which is the time it will take to build the asset.
- Expected __Annual Revenue__ once the asset has been built.
- __Annual Operating expenditure__ to run the asset e.g. in employee salaries, fees, taxes etc.
- __Annual SGA__ (Sales, General, and Administrative Expenses) associated with the asset.
- __Expected cashflow growth__ generally inflation or you can set any percentage e.g. if you expect the prices to increase by 5%.
- Finally __Weighted Annual Cost of Capital__ (WACC) is the rate at which you can get a loan for your investment, normally these are interest rates or a number higher than the current interest rate.

You can then calculate the Net present value of your investment and the 30 year discounted cash flow. Finally you can save these details.

## Asset Analysis

Using this part of the plugin, you can set specific characteristics of a diagram based on the intended use. Details such as people housed, total units and number of floors for a example for a residential diagram, as shown below.

In addition you can set a representative image and compute targetted population density. There are other asset types as well such as Tourism, Office, Retail etc. available as well. As we progress, we will continue to add additional asset classes.

After having set the asset class and the intended use of the diagram, this module  can then compute the services requried for that asset to maintain

## Investment Analysis Library

This is the third module of the plugin. Once you have set the asset details and the financial analysis set for a diagram, this module summarizes them and conducts builds a series of visualizations.

This module analyzes the location of the diagram over the boundary uploaded into Geodesignhub. A boundary is a simple polygon file that can be really any boundary: social, political, economic or administrative. Once the boundary is uploaded, the plugin computes the asset details over that boundary. This is useful to visualize how money flows in the design over time and space.

### Boundary Analysis

Investment over time per boundary, once the capital investment is set, you can then compute how the investment flows over different boundaries. Below is a chorpleth intensity map of investments demonstrating the across various boundaries.

Also as a simple chart.

Once intervention strategy is finalized, all the asset details "rolled up" in one list with all the totals.

Finally the plugin splits the allocations proportionally across different boundaries so you can see how the distribution of jobs, visitors, population and services are split across the different boundaries.
